# NLP From Scratch 🚀

This repository documents my learning journey in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.
It includes:
- Conceptual notes (concise & beginner-friendly)
- Python implementations of core NLP techniques
- Experiments with traditional ML and deep learning models
- Transformer-based models using Hugging Face

## Why this repository?
- To build strong NLP fundamentals
- To track progress publicly
- To create reusable NLP reference material

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NLTK, spaCy
- scikit-learn
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers

## Progress
- [X] Text preprocessing
- [X] Feature extraction
- [ ] Word embeddings
- [ ] Transformers
- [ ] NLP tasks

> Notes are intentionally short and code-focused.
